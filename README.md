# Hepatitis_Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing hepatitis by leveraging machine learning techniques. The model predicts the type of hepatitis a patient may have based on specific symptoms and medical parameters.

Features
Predictive Model: Uses Logistic Regression to predict Hepatitis A, B, C, D, or no hepatitis.
Interactive Interface: Utilizes ipyweight for an interactive user experience in Google Colab.
Comprehensive Parameters: Takes into account multiple medical symptoms and conditions.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Additionally, you need to install several libraries, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and ipyweight.

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn ipyweight
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hepatitis-alert-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd hepatitis-alert-prediction
Open the Google Colab notebook provided in the repository.
bash
Copy code
open Hepatitis_Prediction_Model.ipynb
Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, train the model, and interact with the prediction interface.
Data
The model is trained on a dataset comprising the following parameters:

Gender
Age
Skin_Condition
Eyes_Condition
Urine_Condition
Joint_Pain
Fever
Stomach_Condition
Emesis
Are_You_Hungry
Weakness
Ensure that your dataset is formatted correctly before running the model.

Model
The Logistic Regression model is chosen for its effectiveness in binary and multiclass classification problems. The model is trained using the scikit-learn library.

Interactive Functionality
The ipyweight library is used to create an interactive widget within the Google Colab environment. This allows users to adjust input parameters dynamically and see the prediction results in real-time.
